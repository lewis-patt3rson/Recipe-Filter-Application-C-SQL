# Recipe-Filter-Application-C#-SQL

This is an application that allows you to filter recipes regarding multiple aspects such as ingredients, calorie and other macronutrient restrictions, cuisines and dietary restrictions. 

Users can log in or create accounts to be used in the system to store the recipes they eat in order to track their daily intake and macronutrient balance to ensure they meet their daily goals. 

This application was created on Visual Studio C# as a Windows Form App which connected to an SQL server. (The scripts for creating and populating the database in an SQL server are in the 'database' folder)
